Hi. You should reach out to me if one or more of these statements are true for you:

* You’re struggling with digital addictions to the point that you’re not able to disconnect & let go of your devices despite willful effort to stay off them.
* You’ve tried multiple solutions like installing blockers or removing problematic apps yet you keep using them by bypassing the blockers or end up re-installing deleted apps.
* You successfully distance yourself from screens & apps for anywhere between a few hours to a few days but end up relapsing back worse.
* You give up one source of digital addiction only to see your use of an another app or website go up. For example, you delete your Instagram but end up spending that same time on YouTube instead.
* It is starting to affect crucial areas of your life due to the sheer amount of time you spend on your devices or a specific use case is leading to an adverse reaction in your life.
* Your grades at school & performance at work is suffering mainly because of your digital usage issues.
* Digital addictions have started affecting your relationship with your friends, family or spouse. You spend more time watching virtual humans on a screen than interacting with humans in real life.
* You’re feeling the consequences of your digital use on your mental or physical health. This could be in the form of anxiety, depression, constant fatigue, ADHD or lack of energy to do any tasks. Or a strong shift in your attitudes like feeling extremely negative or pessimistic about society, being socially withdrawn, feeling excessive anger and general apathy
* Digital mediums are your only source of human interaction & you’re unable to replace the same with real life interactions or hobbies.
* You have a very stressful job that involves heavy, erratic usage of digital technology which in turn is taking a toll on you.
* You feel like you’re stuck in a loop of habits & addictions and are unable to get yourself out of it or you feel overwhelmed trying to de-addict yourself while having to balance so many other things in life at the same time.
* You are dealing with more than one addictions or adverse habits & digital technology is aggravating them or is a co-factor. 
* You do not have a problem yet but you catch yourself falling susceptible to the lure of digital technology every once in a while & going ashtray. You would like be more mindful & disciplined about your digital technology usage.
* Your devices completely hijack your brain & take control of your actions once you start using them. Despite using your will power, you are not able to stop. You’re at your wits’ end as to how to cope with not being able to keep away from digital devices
