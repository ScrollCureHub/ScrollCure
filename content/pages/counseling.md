Hi. I offer 1-on-1 counseling & coaching service where we work together to help you build a more intentional relationship with your devices & to cut down on excessive usage. Here's the whys & the hows and a brief description of the entire method.

## A Holistic Solution to A Chronic & Debilitating Problem

As you must have experienced by now, staying away from digital devices is very difficult. You sternly tell yourself “No more!”. You feel guilty. You swear to not ruin an another day. Yet before you know it you're scrolling & tapping on your screen again. You just aren’t able to unglue yourself. Even when it has grave consequences on your life.

Digital de-addiction isn't simply a matter of will power, to guilt yourself or keep your phone locked away. Digital addictions tap into your brain's neurological wiring and disrupt your dopamine & serotonin pathways in a fashion similar to experiencing withdrawals & relapses in more commonly known addictions.

In addition, every strata of life irrevocably relies on digital technology today and your devices are in your palms or within reach at any given moment. You start your day working on a desktop or laptop screen. Your family reaches out to you on your smartphone. You schedule to meet your friend using the messaging app and drive to the venue using GPS on a screen. You pay your bills online. Your book your flights online. You check-in using an e-ticket. Your leisure time entirely consists of browsing reels & watching streams. All your happy moments are posted online & your devices are your number one recourse on bad days.

On the more malicious side of things, the engineers responsible for designing technology today are using extremely powerful tools & advanced data science to exploit the shortcomings of human psychology, cognition, the loneliness epidemic and our deepest biological needs to make their apps & devices as addictive as possible. Some of the brightest minds and richest corporations today are spending tens of millions of dollars to track your behavior down to individual pixels so as to measure your time spent on the devices down to the milliseconds.

The bright red pop-up bubble for messages, the ambient sounds everywhere,  effortless scrolling, erratic notifications, sexually suggestive clickbait images...none of these are arbitrary. Not only do these hooks work & work well, they dig deep into the wiring which is hard encoded in your genes over the course of human evolution. The same mechanism that kept us alive & propagating over millions of years are now used to get us to click on ads & keep scrolling.

This combination of an omniscient presence of technology, the malicious intent in design and the slightest of human mindlessness to get you hooked, makes it a very troublesome & sticky problem to rid yourself from. Just as the forces favoring the vice have an entire ecosystem built around the addiction to keep you hooked; to abstain & absolve yourself from digital addiction, you’ll need to create an entire ecosystem, intentional lifestyle & design changes, and re-design your habits & environment to fight the lure of the digital technology. **The solution has to be holistic.**

## The Structure Of The Solution

The solution can be divided into five major pillars or components which together provide an effective solution at combating digital addiction.

![Graphical Explanation of the Method](/images/Structure.jpg)

i. **Design Barriers:** This consists of placing barricades between yourself and the websites, apps and devices that are causing distress to you. They will be both technological & physical in nature. What makes digital addiction so precarious an addiction is the ease with which it gets you ashtray. You are on a screen every waking hour of the day and just one tap, one swipe, one scroll, one mindless click away from burning hours of your time. Design barriers prevent us from the human mindlessness predisposed to seek stimulation, fidget and wander around mentally while using digital devices. They are intended to either block your use completely or to reduce the ease & smoothness with which the digital technology is used. Using website blockers, ad blockers, time trackers, mindful reminders, de-cluttering your devices, keeping your devices out of sight, et cetera are just some of the commonly known barriers. In addition to these I will be introducing to you a bunch of other design barriers which are less known but quite effective. We'll be using more creative and effective approaches to generate *friction* in your digital usages. 

ii. **Healthy Replacements:** These are activities that are conducted in the real world, have an overwhelming positive effect on various aspects of your life and most importantly, do not involve screens or digital devices. Exercise, communities, hobbies, reading, art, socialization, nature, sports, walks, meditation are just few on top of the list. They are essential in filling up the void created when you aggressively cut-off excess digital usage. Anyone who has ever tried to restrict digital usage by installing blockers, uninstalling apps and relying on sheer will power, knows it doesn’t work for too long & makes you relapse very soon. Ofcourse design barriers are important & they play a quintessential role in my program too but they are not sufficient by themselves. We’ll together work out an entire system based on your interests, time schedules & feasibility to design healthy replacements for you & make it as smooth & effortless as possible for you to indulge in these healthy activities. Some of these are not just an replacement but also necessary to feel good & function normally. Feeling good or more importantly not feeling bad is a crucial element in staying away from addictions as we shall see next. 

iii. **Internal Shifts:** Your brain urges you to seek artificial stimulation when it experiences even the slightest emotional discomfort. It can be in the form of junk food, sugary drinks, smoking or in our case, surfing the net. It doesn't care if this does more harm than good over time or that it makes the foul emotions rebound back harder. It only cares about feeling relieved for as little as few seconds or few minutes. Your brain finds the mindless scrolling as it's only solace. To ward off from your devices, it is crucial that your mind slows down, is balanced emotionally & learns how to deal with discomfort. If you're overwhelmed with stress, if you're depressed, if your thoughts are running at a thousand miles per hour, if you're dealing with constant drama at your workplace, if your relationships are in a jeopardy, it is crucial you re-structure how you deal with these persistent problems. We will work together in instilling some key mindsets & paradigm changes which will help you achieve that & slow down your racing mind. We will take into consideration your family situation, nature of work, personality, lifestyles, other addictions which are strong co-factors for your digital addictions and tailor a better approach towards them. 

iv. **Mindfulness:** Besides having a wider, all-encompassing, overarching positive effect on your life in the form of reduction in stress, over-thinking, anxiety and a dozen other benefits, mindfulness plays a quintessential role in the case of digital minimalism. You must have often noticed that you will end up using your digital devices unconscious to yourself. You have no memory of deliberate thought, contemplation or decision over why you reached out for your phone, why you pulled it out of your pocket, why you opened an app or why you opened another tab on your browser. You just acted in a whirlwind of emotions, an undercurrent of thoughts too subtle to notice and under the hypnotic pull of the devices. You realize only much later into the act and find yourself totally puzzled & unaware, having completely lost the track over your train of thoughts. In such instances, it is mindfulness which helps kick in as a buffer. It is mindfulness that pauses you before you reach to your device, it is mindfulness that helps you detects subtle thoughts & undercurrents and it is also the mindfulness muscle which acts as the second voice in your mind and brings your congnizance back to consciousness when you're neck deep into your digital binge. We'll be working on building your mindfulness muscle over time using meditation & other techniques without any of the woo-woo or esoteric non-sense that usually comes bundled along with it.

v. **Prevention, Relapse & Recovery:** When you cut off your digital usage by a considerable amount your dopamine sensors slowly start reverting back to their normal, unsaturated, unabused states. This is a good thing, it is, but it also leaves you that much more sensitive to any stimulation. What this results into is your brain requiring that much smaller a dose of stimulus to get hooked. As said earlier, you're always just one single tap or scroll away from a full-blown digital binge at any given moment. But you're more susceptible now when your dopamine sensors have refreshed. Not to mention that the neural pathways & habit loops which have been formed over years & decades of use are craving & begging for the hit they've been deprived from. Your mind will start playing tricks on you. It is only a matter of time before you relapse. It is not a question of if it will happen, I assure you, you will relapse. I've relapsed countless times myself too. What is important however that you soon revert back to your original state of digital discipline and regain your composure. The last part of the method deals with preventing a relapse to the best of our abilities and whenever you do relapse, to keep the damage down to a minimum and make the swiftest recovery back to digital discipline.

## Pricing & How It Works


The counseling service has been priced at **$425/month**.

The service I provide is a deeply personalized 1-on-1 counseling & coaching designed to help you regain control over your digital habits. We’ll work together through an open & ongoing dialogue, initially connecting on a daily basis and then on a near-daily basis over the long term. All our communication will be conducted exclusively via email & email only as it is one of the last few communication platforms that is professional, minimal and not contaminated by social mediatization of itself. 

The first 10 days will be intense & we'll be making transformative changes to your digital lifestyle by order of a magnitude. I will be getting in touch with you thrice a day and we'll be diving deep into doing some self-work and restructuring your digital usage patterns. After that, we'll be speaking once every third day and we'll continue to positively incremental changes to your digital discipline & mindfulness. 

Imagine the process as a blend of therapy & personal training where half of our work together will be undoing & preventing the wrongs accumulated over the years and the other half is replacing the same with healthy, wholesome alternatives. 

The system used has been built by me over the course of years. I’ve tried, tested, constructed, repaired & refined the system N numbers of times till it worked consistently for myself & then translated into a method that can be used by others to de-addict themselves from the Internet. Hence, you won't have to grow through the process of re-inventing the wheel and starting from scratch. You can outsource that part to me while you focus on getting your life back in order. I will also be your accountability partner through the same and help you with all your pitfalls & frustrations during the course of your journey.

At no point, will there be any blame, use of shaming, nagging or forceful language from my side to guilt you doing better. You'll be always seen and treated a human being with human nature & it's shortcomings. I'll pre-consider all possibilities from you feeling bored, lazy, having mood swings, feeling low, feeling ecstatic, having bad days, having fights with your spouses, childhood issues, et cetera. I'll tailor the method to your individual personality, lifestyles & commitments, your personality type & goals and your past experiences

I believe this is honest & reasonable pricing for counseling services for an month’s duration. There is only a small & finite number of people that accommodate at a given moment of time while maintaining the standards for quality which is the top priority. Any counseling or coaching service that is provided today is priced anywhere between $150 to $450 per hour. I am not a certified counselor, just someone who is obsessed about digital de-addiction, but I believe I'll be putting a lot more time in than a counselor would. Plus the nature of the work I'll be dealing with will often be grim, grave and demanding of my mental faculties.

**You can expect the following benefits by working with me overtime & getting your digital use under control:**

- You will stop experiencing guilt & shame on a personal level. Though addictions are anything but a flaw on a personal level, when we are caught amidst one, we tend to guilt and blame ourselves on a personal level for lacking the willpower to abstain from our addictions. 
- Your sleep will improve considerably which will have an overwhelming positive effect on your entire life. Not only does the blue light from the devices bring down the quality of your sleep, the overstimulation of your mind from browsing highly short form content during the day time carries over and affects your sleep as well.
- You will get more happiness from the simpler things in life. A sunset will feel that much more vivid & awe inspiring and dinner time conversations with dear friends will be fun again because you're not tempted to keep checking your phone every few minutes.
- Better mental health. Study after study has researched & proven digital usage to cause or lead to a deterioration of mental health. Most major online social platforms today can lead to an increase in anxiety, depression, body image issues, dissatisfaction with life, isolation, social anxiety and rage & anger issues. As the time you spend in front of screens reduces, your mental health issues will alleviate over time & overall your mental health will improve. 
- You get a break from constantly being in a negative head space. Anyone using Twitter, Reddit or platforms which facilitate sociopolitical discourse online, knows how toxic the space can get. Something about the nature of digital technology can make people very polarized, ruthless & extreme on these platforms. Being digitally disciplined gives you to the ability to disconnect or excuse yourself from these spaces whenever you seek a break for your sanity instead of arguing with an anonymous stranger till 5am in the comments section of a post over the latest news and then waking the next morning feeling horrible about it.
- You will have more time on your hands & would be able to actually utilize it. You would have two, four or eight hours of extra time on your hands each day depending on how severe your addiction to screens was and can utilize it in purposeful ways.
- You'll be able to do deep, focused work without distractions
- You regain control & agency over your actions and in-turn over yourself & your life
- You will experience better discipline in all other areas of your life as well.
- Less exposure to junk culture in all forms or shapes, whether it be junk food, celebrity gossip, advertisements, sensationalized content, smoking, drinking, consumption culture, et cetera. This is also crucial to prevent yourself from relapsing into pre-existing addictions & vices.
- Less exposure to toxic personalities, toxic mindsets, conspiracy theories, weird ideologies, cults and hive mind thinking 
- You get to work & contemplate on deeper & bigger things in life whether it be a crucial project you're working on or if you're contemplating what your values are. These are difficult to focus upon when you're constantly browsing distractful short-form content or fighting the constant urge to be on your devices.
- Your become more empathetic to people & towards the issues that plague the world today. You will find your views more centered, considerate and optimistic. You'll find yourself distancing yourself from negative, incorrect & hateful stereotypes.

## FAQs

**Are my details confidential?**

Yes. All conversation we have are completely confidential and for my eyes only. In addition to that, you are not required to share any personal identifications about yourself. You can use an alternate email and a penname during our conversations if you'd like to stay anonymous.

**Can you guarantee I will be completely de-addicted digitally?**

No, unfortunately I can’t. I can assure a marked improvement but not a complete de-addiction nor a full-proof assurance against relapse. This is because of how much we rely on digital devices, the amount of stress & surprises one has to handle on a daily basis today and how we are always a single tap or scroll away from being sucked into hours of mindless use. Unless you have the same level of mindfulness & stress-free lifestyle as some monk living in the Himalayas, you're bound to go ashtray every once in a while. Having said that, I've designed the program & make use of multiple barriers in a way that it tries to lessen this from happening as much as possible. In addition to that, I've also developed methods to make the fastest recovery when one relapses or to pull oneself back from the edge of a possible relapse. 

**I’m embarrassed to say I have a problem/My problem is weird & peculiar**

It’s okay, the entire world today is dealing with the same. Every single person is dealing with digital addiction or some other addiction. You are no different, you're human. In today's time it is not a question of if you will be addicted to something, it is what you will be addicted to. As for feeling weird, know that there is no judgment from my side on anything plus our conversations are completely confidential. I don't care if you're the CEO of a company addicted to playing Candy Crush or a single mom addicted to pornography. You'd be shocked to know how common these issues have become. I'll try my very best to accommodate you & make you feel comfortable no matter how niche, weird or peculiar your addiction is.

**My spouse/kids/entire family is affected by digital addiction. Can we sign up as a couple/family?**

Yes, absolutely! It is actually recommended you sign them up as well, if they willing want to that is, because the people in your immediate environment with whom you spend majority of your time will have a big impact on how you deal with your own habits. It is more challenging to deal with an addiction when the same addiction is heavily being indulged in right in front of you day in day out. For parents, it is important that your kids are safeguarded against digital vices because their young brains are extremely sensitive & susceptible to digital technologies.

**Why is email the only medium of communication that is offered?**

E-mail is the only communication medium which has some semblance of professionalism left & allows for long-form communication. Although email too is started being infested by spam & advertisement, it is much easier to filter that out compared to other mediums. A lot of commonly used chat applications are starting to inculcate addictive aspects of social media platforms which make them distracting & addictive. Email luckily does not have design elements of an addictive nature imbibed into it yet. In addition to that, I do not use social media apps and I refuse to create one or install a separate texting app for any reason whatsoever. 

**I am addicted to & spend more time on desktop/television/gaming/other devices and not a smartphone. Do you help with that?**

Yes! Definitely. I help overcoming all forms of digital addictions and on all screen & device types.

**What if I want to stop next month onwards?**

Sure, there is no compulsion to continue. Feel free to stop. This is not a subscription service & you will not be charged anything unless you willingly wish to continue & willing wish to pay.

**Can I pause the service at any moment I want?**

Yes, absolutely. Just drop an email a day prior and you can take a break as and when required.
